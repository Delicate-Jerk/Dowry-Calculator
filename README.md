## Dowry Calculator 💰📈

Welcome to the Dowry Calculator, a fun and mischievous project brought to you by A^2! Have you ever wondered how much your hypothetical dowry could be worth? Well, wonder no more! This cheeky little calculator takes into account various factors and generates an amusing estimate of your calculated dowry in rupees. 💸✨

## How It Works 🤓🔮

The Dowry Calculator uses a top-secret, super-scientific algorithm to calculate your dowry's worth. It considers your monthly income, profession, employment status, and location to come up with a playful estimate that will surely bring a smile to your face. 🧮🌐

## Factors and Weights ⚖️📊

We've assigned some "interesting" weights to different factors, just for fun:

Profession Weight 👩‍🔬👨‍⚕️👨‍💼: We've assigned weights like a boss! Engineers, doctors, and businessmen get higher weights, while the unemployed get a little less love.
Employment Status Weight 💼🛋️: Are you employed or not? We've got weights for that too. Employed folks get a thumbs up, but hey, we still have something for the unemployed.
Location Weight 🌍🗺️: Location, location, location! Your dowry's worth changes depending on where you are. India, USA, and Australia have their own
